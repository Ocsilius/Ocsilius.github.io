## **"Growth Mindset"**
This is the implementation and execution of the mantra that we are never just stuck at a level of knowledge; I am able to take on problems internalizing that these problems are solveable, and I can just chip at the issue via constant and varied learning modalities and resources. It is the manner in which one realizes there is an _ebb and flow_ to tackling projects. You *will* get temporarily stuck in a pit, yet realize you can learn to deal with the parts of that project and eventually expand your body of knowledge in the process.
A difficult concept to swallow for growth mindset is being open to and accepting criticism, as well as the frustration that comes with bowling into new, overwhelming problems. Just because another person was successful in a similar or the same endeavor _does not mean that **I** need to accomplish my task in the same way_. You will get dirty, angry, frustrated, and inevitably lose focus (_temporarily_) on why you are choosing that hard road. That's the time that you need to go to that mantra of improvement bit by bit until the goal is reached. Passivity will not bring results.

## Self-Reminders

1. *When I am stuck on the problem, try a different aspect of the project and come back to it later while still progressing.*
1. *Utilize all resources available - One resource may not fit my style at times, and I can access many sources in my journey.*
1. *When it gets hard if I keep at it I will get through. Learning never stops, even if it has seemed to in the moment.*

## Text Editor Notes

- There is no *best text editor*, so you need to just try a variety and use them to see how it works for your workflow and style.
- Recommended Features
1. Code Completion - Finishes and adds to code as you type by predicting/suggesting text. This removes cumbersome additions that are normally required (such as creating an end tag like </i> tags that will stop an element by hand rather than having the current text wrapped within the start and end tags.
1. Syntax Highlighting - applies highlighted text according to type to allow another level of understanding without having to examine each element when looking for mistakes.
1. A variety of themes - this will help with eye strain and during long hours. Most use a dark background and bright text.
1. Extensions galore - Extra features that create more functionality than the base editor. These can be used to customize the coding experience, and streamline the particular type you are working on.

### Text Editors

- Pre-installed on every computer. I use a PC and Linux. Notepad = PC editor, and Debian uses an assortment of text editors including Featherpad, but these are easy to add via package retrieval/installation.

- Important aspects of text editors.
1. Plain text (no inherent italic, underline, etc.)
1. Store the website in a different folder that is dedicated to your work rather than in the default folder structure.
1. Ensure appropriate extension on title name (`___.html`, `____.css`). 
1. They are generally not feature-rich, so trying Third-Party is an easy way to see what is possible.

### Free, robust text editors:
- Notepad++ - for Windows only
- TextWrangler/BB Edit - Mac Only
- Visual Studio Code - Available on Mac, Windows, Linux, and made by Microsoft, with a lot of support (*I have been using this as well as Atom in the past year*)
- Atom - Available on Windows, Mac, and Linux, and has a lot of features that work with GitHub since the same creators made this product.
- Brackets - Free for the main 3 platforms, made by Adobe ***and only supports HTML, CSS, and JavaScript*** without added extensions.
- Sublime Text - Premium $70 software. _I would need to investigate whether premium actually makes a difference from my usual text editor._

#### IDEs

- Integrated Development Environments
- One package that includes a text editor, file manager, compiler, and debugger.
