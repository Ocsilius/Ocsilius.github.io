## **"Growth Mindset"**
This is the implementation and execution of the mantra that we are never just stuck at a level of knowledge; I am able to take on problems internalizing that these problems are solveable, and I can just chip at the issue via constant and varied learning modalities and resources. It is the manner in which one realizes there is an _ebb and flow_ to tackling projects. You *will* get temporarily stuck in a pit, yet realize you can learn to deal with the parts of that project and eventually expand your body of knowledge in the process.
A difficult concept to swallow for growth mindset is being open to and accepting criticism, as well as the frustration that comes with bowling into new, overwhelming problems. Just because another person was successful in a similar or the same endeavor _does not mean that **I** need to accomplish my task in the same way_. You will get dirty, angry, frustrated, and inevitably lose focus (_temporarily_) on why you are choosing that hard road. That's the time that you need to go to that mantra of improvement bit by bit until the goal is reached. Passivity will not bring results.
