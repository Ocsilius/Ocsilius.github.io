## Text Editor Notes

- There is no *best text editor*, so you need to just try a variety and use them to see how it works for your workflow and style.
- Recommended Features
1. Code Completion - Finishes and adds to code as you type by predicting/suggesting text. This removes cumbersome additions that are normally required (such as creating an end tag like </i> tags that will stop an element by hand rather than having the current text wrapped within the start and end tags.
1. Syntax Highlighting - applies highlighted text according to type to allow another level of understanding without having to examine each element when looking for mistakes.
1. A variety of themes - this will help with eye strain and during long hours. Most use a dark background and bright text.
1. Extensions galore - Extra features that create more functionality than the base editor. These can be used to customize the coding experience, and streamline the particular type you are working on.

### Text Editors

- Pre-installed on every computer. I use a PC and Linux. Notepad = PC editor, and Debian uses an assortment of text editors including Featherpad, but these are easy to add via package retrieval/installation.

- Important aspects of text editors.
1. Plain text (no inherent italic, underline, etc.)
1. Store the website in a different folder that is dedicated to your work rather than in the default folder structure.
1. Ensure appropriate extension on title name (`___.html`, `____.css`). 
1. They are generally not feature-rich, so trying Third-Party is an easy way to see what is possible.

### Free, robust text editors:
- Notepad++ - for Windows only
- TextWrangler/BB Edit - Mac Only
- Visual Studio Code - Available on Mac, Windows, Linux, and made by Microsoft, with a lot of support (*I have been using this as well as Atom in the past year*)
- Atom - Available on Windows, Mac, and Linux, and has a lot of features that work with GitHub since the same creators made this product.
- Brackets - Free for the main 3 platforms, made by Adobe ***and only supports HTML, CSS, and JavaScript*** without added extensions.
- Sublime Text - Premium $70 software. _I would need to investigate whether premium actually makes a difference from my usual text editor._

#### IDEs

- Integrated Development Environments
- One package that includes a text editor, file manager, compiler, and debugger.
