# Coder's Computer

I had *some* experience with the _command line/Powershell_ terminal, but it is always a frustrating experience that hours, sometimes
days later can result in temporary elation as something works. The version point of the setting up the computer part of this
lab had me stumped for quite a bit, with npm and JSNode making life *hell* by acting as if they were installed, then resulting in errors. I went to the resource Google to figure out, as Stack Overflow has some good responses with a variety of suggestions to tackle the error. I needed to remove Node and reinstall with a different curl/bash line than what was in the setting up the computer pages.`
