# Coder's Computer

I had *some* experience with the _command line/Powershell_ terminal, but it is always a frustrating experience that hours, sometimes
days later can result in temporary elation as something works. The version point of the setting up the computer part of this
lab had me stumped for quite a bit, with npm and JSNode making life *hell* by acting as if they were installed, then resulting in errors. I went to the resource Google to figure out, as Stack Overflow has some good responses with a variety of suggestions to tackle the error. I needed to remove Node and reinstall with a different curl/bash line than what was in the setting up the computer pages.

## Command Line
### Terms

1. **Bash** *(Bourne again shell).
1. **Echo** *States current shell*.

## Navigating the terminal
### Commands

- pwd - "Print Working Directory" - _where you are._
- ls - "List" - _What is in the current directory._ Structure **ls[options][location]**
- cd [location] = Change directory. _cd alone will take you back to home directory_


### Paths

- Absolute and relative
1. Top=root *(/)*
1. Absolute is in relation to the root directory. *Always start with a forward slash*.
1. Relative paths will not begin with a slash.

### Path vocabulary

- ~ = Shortcut ot the home directory *(i.e. ~/Documents rather than /home/NAME/Documents)*
- . = Current directory. Also can be written as **./`____`*
- .. = References the parent directory - can be used several times to indicate path up the hierarchy.

### Extra
- Tab Completion = Tab will autocomplete when you begin typing an action/path.


## Files

### Linux Notes

- Linux is devoid of extensions. ***file*[path]*** will state what the type of file is.
- Linux is case sensitive. It's a common problem.
- There can be spaces between file and directory names. You can deal with this with **Quotes** around the entire item or escape characters *(\).*
- If a file begins with a **"."** it is hidden. You can change the name of a file to hide/reveal it just by adding a *.* to the front. **Including** ***-a*** **in the command line does show hidden files and directories.**
